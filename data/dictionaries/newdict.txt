# CAMEO VERB PATTERN DICTIONARY
# This dictionary is a composite of the TABARI CAMEO dictionaries and several synonym 
# sets, primarily from WordNet. It is formatted for the PETRARCH automated coding program,
# version 1.0: consult the general documentation and specifically the internal comments in 
# the routine PETRreader.read_verb_dictionary() for details of the formatting and 
# interpretation of the file.
#
# Patterns in this file were initially derived from the long-standing CAMEO verb file 
# CAMEO.091003.master.verbs. In the comments section of the patterns, the verb[s] where 
# the pattern was originally found is shown, followed by any coder information on the 
# pattern.
#
# Notes on dictionary status <14.06.10>
#  There are a *lot* of unnecessary patterns in here, either leftovers for earlier 
#    noun-verb disambiguation -- PETRARCH handles this with the Treebank parsing, not 
#    with the dictionaries -- or patterns which simply go to the default code in the 
#    verb block. At this point we are just trying to get this running: it could use a 
#    lot of additional work.
#
# Major update <15.04.30>
# Multi-word forms -- these have a '+' in them -- were not being handled consistently.
# The program was revised to generate regular forms; all irregular forms were added;
# assorted phrases, notably those involved 'RE_' (which is what 're-...' ends up as)
# where the verb was the final word were correctly marked, and an assortment of 
# multi-word noun phrases inherited from TABARI, which wasn't as picky about such 
# things, were deleted.
#
# Dictionary development has been funded by the Political Science and Methods, 
# Measurement and Statistics programs of the U.S. National Science Foundation through
