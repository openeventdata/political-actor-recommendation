# Global variables are listed below: additional details on their structure can
# be found in various function definitions. The various options are described
# in more detail in the config.ini file.

# CODING OPTIONS
# Defaults are more or less equivalent to TABARI
NewActorLength = 0  # Maximum length for new actors extracted from noun phrases
RequireDyad = True  # Events require a non-null source and target
StoponError = False  # Raise stop exception on errors rather than recovering

# OUTPUT OPTIONS
WriteActorRoot = False  # Include actor root in event record :: currently not implemented
WriteActorText = False  # Include actor text in event record
WriteEventText = False  # Include event text in event record

RunTimeString = ''  # used in error and debugging files -- just set it once

# INTERFACE OPTIONS: these can be changed in config.ini
# The default -- all false -- is equivalent to an A)utocode in TABARI
CodeBySentence = False
PauseBySentence = False
PauseByStory = False

# COMMA OPTION : These adjust the length (in words) of comma-delimited clauses
# that are eliminated from the parse. To deactivate, set the max to zero.
#         Defaults, based on TABARI, are in ()
#         comma_min :  internal clause minimum length [2]
#         comma_max :  internal clause maximum length [8]
#         comma_bmin : initial ("begin") clause minimum length [0]
#         comma_bmax : initial clause maximum length [0 : deactivated by default]
#         comma_emin : terminal ("end") clause minimum length [2]
#         comma_emax : terminal clause maximum length [8]

# TEMPORARY VARIABLES
# <14.11.20> Temporary in the sense that these won't be needed when we eventually
# refactor so that codes are some sort of structure other than a string
CodePrimer = '=#='   # separates actor code from root and text strings
RootPrimer = CodePrimer + ':'  # start of root string
TextPrimer = CodePrimer + '+'  # start of text string
