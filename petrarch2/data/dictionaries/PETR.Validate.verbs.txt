<!-- PETRARCH VALIDATION SUITE VERBS DICTIONARY -->
<!-- VERSION: 0.1 -->
<!-- Last Update: 28 April 2014 -->

<!-- Note: This dictionary started out as part of a KEDS dictionary -- hence most of   -->
<!-- the codes are WEIS, not CAMEO -- and then small parts of it were tweaked quite    -->
<!-- unsystematically to accommodate various unit tests over the years. Most of the    -->
<!-- patterns here are not, in fact, actually used in the PETRARCH unit tests, and at  -->
<!-- some point the whole thing should be edited and substantially reduced in size, as -->
<!-- at which point we should also add unique identifiers to the patterns so one can   -->
<!-- associate specific tests with specific patterns. But at the moment it is mostly   -->
<!-- just that ad hoc KEDS-based dictionary.  Sorry.                                   -->
